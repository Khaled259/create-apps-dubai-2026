# 📱 Lesson 6: Front-End Mobile App Development (Code)

**Topic:** Native & Cross-Platform Development
**Languages:** Swift, Kotlin, JavaScript

---

## 📝 Summary
This lesson dives into "Native" mobile development, distinguishing between building specifically for Apple (iOS) or Android, versus using Cross-Platform tools.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. iOS Development (Apple)
*   **Language:** Swift (Fast, safe, expressive).
*   **IDE:** Xcode (Mac only).
*   **UI Framework:** **SwiftUI** (Declarative syntax: "Describe what you want, it handles the rest").

### 2. Android Development (Google)
*   **Language:** Kotlin (Modern, interoperable with Java).
*   **IDE:** Android Studio (Windows, Mac, Linux).
*   **UI Framework:** **Jetpack Compose** (Similar to SwiftUI, declarative UI).

### 3. Cross-Platform (React Native)
*   **Language:** JavaScript (React).
*   **Concept:** Write code once, deploy to both iOS and Android.
*   **Pros:** Shared codebase, faster to ship, huge community (Meta/Facebook).
*   **Cons:** Might lag behind on latest native features, potential performance trade-offs for very complex apps.
