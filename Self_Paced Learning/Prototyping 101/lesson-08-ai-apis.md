# 🤖 Lesson 8: Building AI Apps with APIs

**Topic:** Integrating Generative AI (GPT-4)
**Tools:** OpenAI API, Postman (implied)

---

## 📝 Summary
Introduces how to make apps "smart" by connecting them to AI models like GPT-4 or Gemini via APIs.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. What is an API?
*   **Analogy:** A "Waiter" that takes your order (request), gives it to the kitchen (server), and brings back food (response).
*   **Use:** Allows your app to use ChatGPT's brain without you building an AI from scratch.

### 2. Generative AI (Gen AI)
*   Powered by **LLMs** (Large Language Models).
*   **Capabilities:** Chatbots, Summarization, Code generation, Image generation (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion).
*   **Key Models:** GPT-4 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), Falcon 40B (UAE Open Source).

### 3. How to use it
1.  **Sign Up:** Get an account (OpenAI, Google, etc.).
2.  **Get Key:** Generate an **API Key** (Keep this secret!).
3.  **Make Call:** Send a "Prompt" -> Receive "Response".
