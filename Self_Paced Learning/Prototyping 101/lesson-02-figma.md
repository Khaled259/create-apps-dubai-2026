# 🎨 Lesson 2: Prototyping with Figma

**Topic:** Prototyping for Mobile & Web
**Tools:** Figma, FigJam (Mentioned: Visily, Adobe XD, Sketch)

---

## 📝 Summary
This session introduced Figma as a cloud-based design tool essential for modern app development. It covered the difference between low-fidelity (sketches) and high-fidelity (interactive) prototypes and walked through building a clickable mobile app prototype.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. The Importance of Prototyping
*   **Blueprint:** acts as a sketch before construction to save time and avoid coding errors.
*   **Low-Fidelity (Lo-Fi):** Focuses on user flow and function. (Tool: **FigJam**)
*   **High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi):** Polished visuals, colors, fonts, and interactivity. (Tool: **Figma**)

### 2. Figma Features
*   **Cloud-Based:** Runs in the browser, real-time collaboration (like Google Docs).
*   **Vector Graphics:** Designs are scalable without losing quality.
*   **Frames:** essentially screens (e.g., iPhone 16 preset).
*   **Interactivity:** Link buttons to different screens to simulate a real app experience.

### 3. Alternative Tools
| Tool | Best For |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visily** | AI-powered, quick wireframing for beginners. |
| **Adobe XD** | Animation and Adobe Suite integration. |
| **Sketch** | Vector design for Mac users (less collaborative). |
