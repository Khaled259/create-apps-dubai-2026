## 📝 Summary
The final lesson combines all tools into a "Modern AI Workflow". It moves away from writing everything from scratch to orchestrating AI tools to build apps fast.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### The "AI Stack" Workflow

1.  **Design (UI/UX):**
    *   **Tool:** **Visily**.
    *   **Action:** Convert a hand-drawn sketch or text prompt into a high-fidelity design.

2.  **Frontend (Code Generation):**
    *   **Tool:** **v0 (by Vercel)**.
    *   **Action:** Describe a component (e.g., "A pricing table") -> It generates the React/Tailwind code.

3.  **Backend (Logic/Database):**
    *   **Tool:** **Buildship**.
    *   **Action:** Visual low-code builder for backend logic (APIs, Database connections) powered by AI.

4.  **Refinement & Assembly:**
    *   **Tool:** **Claude** (for high-level architecture/logic) & **Cursor** (for editing/refactoring).
    *   **Action:** Glue the pieces together and fix bugs.
