## 📝 Summary
Shifted focus from mobile to web development. Explained the core structure of web apps (Frontend, Backend, Database) and demonstrated building a "To-Do List" app using **Bubble**.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Web App Structure
*   **Frontend:** What the user sees (HTML/CSS/JS equivalent).
*   **Backend:** Logic, processing, and security (Node.js/Python equivalent).
*   **Database:** Stores data (Usernames, Tasks, etc.).

### 2. Why Web Apps?
*   **Accessibility:** Runs on any device with a browser.
*   **Freedom:** No App Store rules/approvals needed to launch.
*   **Scalability:** Many mobile apps use web backends to store data.

### 3. Bubble Workflow
*   **Design Tab:** Drag elements (Input fields, Repeating Groups for lists).
*   **Workflow Tab:** "When Button Clicked -> Create a new thing in Database".
*   **Data Tab:** Define data types (e.g., "Task" with field "Task Name").
