---

## 📝 Summary
Explains the "invisible" side of apps: the Back-End. It handles data storage, processing, and security.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Core Components
*   **Server:** Listens for requests (e.g., "Log me in") and sends responses.
*   **Database:**
    *   **SQL (Relational):** Tables, rows, columns. (MySQL, PostgreSQL). Best for structured data.
    *   **NoSQL (Non-Relational):** Flexible documents/JSON. (MongoDB, Firebase). Best for unstructured data.

### 2. Frameworks
*   **Lightweight (Micro-frameworks):**
    *   **Flask (Python):** Simple, great for small APIs.
    *   **Express (Node.js/JS):** Fast, scalable, uses JavaScript everywhere.
*   **Full-Stack (Batteries Included):**
    *   **Ruby on Rails (Ruby):** "Convention over Configuration". Fast setup for big apps.
    *   **Laravel (PHP):** Powerful, popular for enterprise.
    *   **Next.js (React/JS):** Server-side rendering, SEO friendly.
