# 📱 Lesson 3: No-Code Mobile App Development

**Topic:** Building Mobile Apps without Code
**Tools:** Thunkable

---

## 📝 Summary
Focused on **Thunkable**, a platform allowing users to build cross-platform mobile apps (iOS & Android) using a drag-and-drop interface and logic blocks.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. No-Code Development
*   Allows building functional apps without knowing syntax.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** Connects your app to outside services (e.g., pulling weather data) without writing complex code.

### 2. Thunkable Interface
*   **Design Tab:** Where you build the UI (Buttons, Labels, Inputs).
*   **Blocks Tab:** Where you define behavior/logic (e.g., "When Button Clicked -> Show Text").
*   **Live Test:** Test the app instantly on a real phone via the Thunkable Live companion app.

### 3. Pros & Cons
*   **Pros:** Cross-platform (React Native based), easy for beginners, fast prototyping.
*   **Cons:** Limited access to latest hardware features (e.g., Dynamic Island), complex logic can get messy visually.
