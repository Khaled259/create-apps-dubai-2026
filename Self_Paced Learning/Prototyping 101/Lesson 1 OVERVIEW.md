## 📝 Lesson Notes

### 1. Introduction to Mobile & Web App Development
**Summary:** An overview of the app development landscape, distinguishing between Web and Mobile apps, and the three major approaches to building them (No-Code, Full Code, and AI-Assisted).

#### 🔑 Key Concepts

**1. Prototyping (The Blueprint)**
*   Before coding, you must prototype to visualize ideas and identify issues.
*   **Key Tool:** **Figma** (Standard for designers/developers).

**2. Web App Development**
Apps accessed via browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
*   **Frontend (User sees):** HTML (Structure), CSS (Style), JavaScript (Logic).
*   **Backend (Server side):** Node.js (JavaScript), Flask (Python).
*   **Database:** Stores user data (accounts, progress, etc.).

**3. Mobile App Development**
*   **iOS (Apple):** Uses **Swift** & **Xcode**.
*   **Android (Google):** Uses **Kotlin** & **Android Studio**.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Uses **React Native** (Write code once, deploy to both iOS & Android).

**4. Development Approaches**
| Approach | Description | Tools Mentioned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No Code** | Drag-and-drop, like "digital Lego". Best for non-coders/fast prototyping. | Bubble, Glide |
| **Full Code** | Writing actual code. flexible and custom. | Swift, Kotlin, JS, Python |
| **AI Coding** | Using AI to write code or power features. | **APIs:** GPT-4 <br> **Assistants:** GitHub Copilot, Cursor |

#### 🧠 Quiz Notes
*   **Question:** Which of these was an app development platform introduced in the video?
*   **Answer:** **Xcode** (Mentioned as the native tool for iOS development).
