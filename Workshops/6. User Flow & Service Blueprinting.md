## 2. Shaping Your Idea: The Deliverables
Participants are working towards submitting four key items by December 15th:
1.  **App Business Canvas:** A fully developed business model with a differentiated value proposition.
2.  **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** A clear definition of the product with a go-to-market strategy.
3.  **Service Blueprint:** A clickable prototype that demonstrates the user flow.
4.  **Pitch Deck & Video:** A 5-minute video pitch including a 2-minute app demo.

## 3. UX Design Fundamentals
Kirin, the UX expert, introduced the core concepts of User Experience (UX) Design.

### A. What is UX?
* **Definition:** The experience a person has when interacting with a digital interface, shaped by how it works, feels, and fits into their needs.
* **Goal:** To make interactions intuitive, effective, and meaningful.
* **The "Sweet Spot":** UX operates at the intersection of **Desirability** (User wants it), **Feasibility** (Can build it), and **Viability** (Business value).

### B. Good vs. Bad UX (The Shower Analogy)
* **Bad UX:** A shower with two separate knobs for hot/cold where you don't know which is which. It creates uncertainty, requires trial-and-error, and reduces user confidence.
* **Good UX:** A shower with one knob for On/Off and another labeled clearly for temperature. It is predictable, intuitive, and puts the user in control.
* **Lesson:** Users should not have to "think" too hard to perform basic tasks.

### C. The 4 E's of UX Design
1.  **Effective:** Delivers what it promises (e.g., **Google Maps** focuses solely on getting you from A to B with no distractions).
2.  **Enjoyable:** Doesn't induce mental load; offers rewards (e.g., **Duolingo** uses gamification, streaks, and progress bars to make learning fun).
3.  **Easy:** Low effort to set up and use; uses familiar patterns (e.g., **Spotify** uses clear navigation and familiar icons like "Home" and "Search").
4.  **Emotional:** Addresses a long-term goal, dream, or fear (e.g., **Headspace** uses calming visuals and tone to build trust and connection).

## 4. Service Blueprinting
Before designing screens, you must map the entire service ecosystem.

### A. What is a Service Blueprint?
A visual tool to design how a concept works end-to-end, linking user actions to backstage processes. It prevents the issue of having a "great idea" that is technically impossible to build.

### B. The 5 Lanes of a Service Blueprint
1.  **Physical Evidence:** What the user sees/touches (e.g., App Screen, E-ticket, Theater Building).
2.  **User Actions:** What the user does (e.g., Clicks "Book," Arrives at studio).
3.  **Front Stage:** What happens in direct view of the user (e.g., App shows search results, Receptionist greets user).
4.  **Back Stage:** Processes happening behind the scenes (e.g., System queries database for availability).
5.  **Supporting Actions:** Third-party systems or internal departments (e.g., Payment Gateway, IT Support, Finance Dept).

### C. Example: ClassPass Flow
* *User Action:* User searches for a class.
* *Front Stage:* App shows search bar and dynamic results.
* *Back Stage:* Database is queried.
* *Supporting:* API pulls schedule from the Partner Studio’s system.

## 5. Design Fidelity
Understanding "how much detail" to put into your prototype at different stages.

1.  **Low Fidelity (Lo-Fi):**
    * *Visuals:* Rough sketches, boxes, placeholder text.
    * *Purpose:* To test conceptual ideas and structure. "Does the flow make sense?"
2.  **Medium Fidelity (Mid-Fi):**
    * *Visuals:* Grayscale, no colors/branding yet, simple clickable flows.
    * *Purpose:* To validate logic, hierarchy, and navigation.
3.  **High Fidelity (Hi-Fi):**
    * *Visuals:* Polished UI, colors, typography, real content, animations.
    * *Purpose:* Usability testing and developer hand-off.
* **Tip:** Stick to Lo/Mid-Fi for now. If you show Hi-Fi too early, people give feedback on colors ("I don't like green") rather than the concept ("I don't understand this feature").

## 6. AI-Enhanced Prototyping (Live Demo)
The session demonstrated how to use AI tools (specifically **Lovable**) to generate a clickable prototype from a text prompt.

### A. The Workflow
1.  **Define Goal:** Set the scope (e.g., "I want a booking flow").
2.  **Prompt:** Ask AI to create wireframes based on your inputs (Personas, Value Prop).
3.  **Refine:** Ask AI to adjust hierarchy, add navigation, or change labels.
4.  **Link:** Connect screens to make it clickable.

### B. Example Prompt Strategy used in Demo
* **Context:** "Create an AI flow represented as clickable wireframes for a digital product... tailored for a sports booking app like ClassPass."
* **Details:** "Include specific screens: Home (with search/chips), Class Details, Booking Confirmation, My Bookings."
* **Iterative Prompting:**
    * *Critique:* "The home page is missing location context."
    * *Fix:* "Adjust the homepage to include a city overview on top. If clicked, redirect to a map view."
    * *Critique:* "There is no navigation."
    * *Fix:* "Add a sticky bottom navigation bar with Home, Upcoming, Classes, and Account."

### C. Recommended AI Tools
* **Lovable** (Used in demo)
* **Uizard**
* **Balsamiq**
* **Figma (with AI plugins)**
* **Relume**

## 7. Purposeful Testing
Why test early? To "Fail Fast, Fail Soon, Fail Easy."

* **Risk Management:** Reduce the uncertainty of "Unknown Unknowns" (blind spots).
* **Focus:** Test the **concept** and **functionality**, not the pixels.
* **Three Lenses:** Test for Desirability (Do they want it?), Feasibility (Can we build it?), and Viability (Is it a business?).
* **Action:** Take your Lo-Fi prototype to the 10-15 users you interviewed in the research phase and validate if your solution actually solves their problem.

## 8. Homework & Next Steps
* **Download:** The Service Blueprint Canvas and the "Clickable UX Wireframe Prototype Prompt" PDF.
* **Task:** Create a Service Blueprint for your main user journey.
* **Task:** Use an AI tool to generate a Lo-Fi/Mid-Fi clickable prototype.
* **Next Workshop:** Wednesday, Nov 26th (Focus on UI Design and making it look good).
