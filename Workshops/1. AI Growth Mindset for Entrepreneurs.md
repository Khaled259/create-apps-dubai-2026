## 2. Understanding Mindsets
The lecture contrasts three types of mindsets crucial for entrepreneurs.

### A. Fixed Mindset
* **Definition:** Belief that abilities and intelligence are static.
* **Behaviors:** Avoiding challenges, giving up easily, viewing effort as fruitless, sticking to routine ("We've always done it this way").
* **Entrepreneurial Example:** "I'm afraid to use AI because I know nothing about it" or "I will fail, so there is no need to try."

### B. Growth Mindset
* **Definition:** Belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
* **Behaviors:** Resilience, seeing failure as an opportunity to learn, "grit" (perseverance).
* **Motto:** "Just Do It" (Nike).
* **Reframing:** Instead of "I can't do this," saying "I can't do this **yet**."

### C. AI First Mindset
* **Definition:** Viewing AI not just as a tool, but as a **strategic partner** woven into every decision, process, and product.
* **Key Shift:** Moving from "Can AI help?" to **"How can AI elevate this?"**
* **Core Pillars:**
    1.  **Reimagine Customer Experience:** Using empathy mapping and AI to personalize experiences at scale.
    2.  **Data-Driven Decisions:** embracing data for strategic choices.
    3.  **Unlock Efficiency:** Automating manual work to focus on high-value tasks.
    4.  **Innovation:** Using AI to find new revenue streams and scalable solutions.

## 3. The AI First Mindset in Action
How does an "AI First" entrepreneur behave?

### Four Key Actions
1.  **Embed AI Strategically:** Make AI a standing agenda item. Ask: *How can AI inform, automate, or enhance this choice?*
2.  **Reimagine Journeys:** Personalize customer journeys (e.g., tailored recommendations, predictive support).
3.  **Automate for Efficiency:** Identify repetitive processes (finance, marketing, ops) to automate.
4.  **Build AI Literacy:** Encourage the entire team (not just tech) to experiment with AI tools.

## 4. Practical Workshop: AI Tools & Techniques
Rob provided a live demonstration of using various AI tools for the app development lifecycle.

### A. Brainstorming & Problem Definition (Tool: Gemini / ChatGPT / Claude)
* **The TAG Framework for Prompts:**
    * **T (Task):** What is the overall objective?
    * **A (Action):** What specific step are we doing now?
    * **G (Goal):** What does success look like?
* **Technique: "Ask Me Questions"**
    * Instead of asking AI to just "fix" a vague problem statement, ask AI to interview you.
    * *Prompt Example:* "Can you ask me 3 questions to know more about the statement so you can help me better define it? Ask me one at a time."
    * **Benefit:** This forces you to provide specific context (Who, What, Where, Why, Status Quo) which leads to a much higher quality output.
* **Case Study:** Refined a vague idea ("App for students to be organized") into a specific problem statement about college undergraduates struggling with perfectionism and time-blocking.

### B. Voice Mode for Brainstorming (Tool: ChatGPT Mobile App)
* **Usage:** Use voice mode to "word vomit" ideas when stuck or while multitasking (walking, driving).
* **Example:** Spoke to ChatGPT to create a storyboard and script for a launch video.
* **Benefit:** Natural conversation allows for rapid iteration and clearing up mental blocks without the friction of typing.

### C. Video Creation (Tools: Synthesia & Pictory)
* **Synthesia:**
    * **Input:** Works best with **Storyboards**.
    * **Features:** High-quality AI avatars, good voice control, ability to clone your own voice (via ElevenLabs integration).
    * **Workflow:** Generates scenes based on the storyboard, allows editing of visuals and text.
* **Pictory:**
    * **Input:** Works best with **Scripts**.
    * **Features:** Faster generation, matches stock footage to script keywords.
    * **Workflow:** Upload script -> AI selects visuals -> Select AI Voice -> Generate Video.
* **Comparison:** Synthesia is better for "talking head" style presentation; Pictory is great for stock footage compilations. Both allow branding integration.

### D. UI/UX Mockups (Tool: Claude)
* **Why Claude?** Currently considered superior for creativity and coding/design tasks compared to others.
* **Process:**
    1.  Use Gemini to generate a text description of a landing page layout.
    2.  Feed that description into Claude.
    3.  *Prompt:* "Build a mockup layout based on this info... I will reward you if it's good." (Gamification of prompts can sometimes improve focus).
* **Output:** Claude generates functional HTML/CSS code that renders a visual preview of the app interface directly in the chat window.

### E. Image Generation (Tool: Gemini / Chat GPT Sora)
* **Gemini:** Recently updated model excels at realistic image generation.
* **Usage:** "Generate an image of a student using my app, make it realistic."
* **Tip:** Use the text tool to help you write a detailed image prompt first, then feed it to the image generator.

## 6. Conclusion: The "Stop, Start, Continue" Action Plan
To adopt an AI Growth Mindset, entrepreneurs should:

* **STOP:**
    * Making decisions based solely on "gut feeling" (ignore data).
    * Treating AI as a one-off tool.
    * Delaying adoption until competitors prove it works.
    * Overloading teams with manual tasks that can be automated.
* **START:**
    * Asking **"How can AI elevate this?"** for every project/email/proposal.
    * Using AI to challenge assumptions and test scenarios.
    * Training the team on AI literacy (Teach-backs).
    * Piloting small, low-risk AI projects immediately.
* **CONTINUE:**
    * Showing up and being curious (Growth Mindset).
    * Combining AI speed with **human-centric ethics**.
    * Experimenting with new tools.
    * Reviewing processes regularly with both data and human insight.
